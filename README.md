# Notes & Explanations

CODE:

Careated a script which takes the webserver log file and uses the separate class objects to perform dedicated oprations on log file like reading, parsing and finally displaying the data in readable format.

TESTING:

Created corresponding test cases for each class and tried to cover the validations and business logic for each class.

EXTENDING:

The code can be further extended to include more validations and test scenarios. Moreover, the functional comments can be added to functions of individual classes as well.
